# How to run the code locally 

First, install the dependecies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

After that, you can run the following command to run the server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is up and running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
